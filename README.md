## Introduction

Tweezer provides APIs to generate data sets.

1. `Twitter Advanced Search`: Allows you to scrape tweets returned from twitter advanced search.

## Quick Start

Say you want to scrape tweets using the twitter advanced search.

### Construct your search URL

1. Go to [twitter advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced), construct your search query and hit `search`.
2. Copy over the URL generated.
3. Replace the `twitter.com` with `dark-tweezer.herokuapp.com`.

For example, 

`Twitter URL`: <https://twitter.com/search?l=en&q=%40RickAndMorty%20since%3A2019-01-01%20until%3A2019-07-13&src=typd>

`Modified URL`: <https://dark-tweezer.herokuapp.com/search?l=en&q=%40RickAndMorty%20since%3A2019-01-01%20until%3A2019-07-13&src=typd>

### Download tweets from browser

Paste the `Modified URL` from the above step into your broswer and wait for the download to complete. 

You should have a file called `tweets.json` in your downloads directory.

### Download/view tweets from CLI

Assuming you have [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) installed.

**Download to a file**

```bash
$ curl "https://dark-tweezer.herokuapp.com/search?l=en&q=%40RickAndMorty%20since%3A2019-01-01%20until%3A2019-07-13&src=typd" -o pickle_rick.json

## APIs in code

### Search with Python: >= 3.6

**Create a file called example.py in your virtual environment**

```python
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from aiohttp.client import ClientTimeout
from asyncio import get_event_loop
from textwrap import wrap
from time import time
from tweezer.client import search

# Default timeout is 5 min.
# For long scraping tasks this is not enough.
_TIMEOUT = ClientTimeout(total=(15*60))


async def main():
    # Search parameters.
    search_params = {"date": ["2019-01-01", "2019-07-13"],
                     "lang": "en",
                     "mention": ["RickAndMorty"]}

    # Use the client session to make requests to tweezer.
    async with ClientSession(timeout=_TIMEOUT) as session:
        # Just cause you like me is interested in performance
        start_time = time()
        total_tweets = 0

        # Print out all the tweets that is being returned back from the server
        async for tweet in search(session, search_params):
            total_tweets += 1

            # Do your thing with the tweet
            # Here we will just print out the tweet.
            if tweet.lang != "en":
                continue

            # Header of the tweet
            header = "\n\tTweet" if not tweet.is_reply else \
                     f"\n\tReplying to: https://twitter.com/statuses/{tweet.parent_id}"
            print(header)
            print(f"\t{'-' * (len(header) - 1)}")

            # Print out the body of the tweet
            print(f"\tURL: {tweet.permalink}")
            print(f"\tUsername: {tweet.username} | Date: {tweet.time} | Language: {tweet.lang}")

            text_lines = wrap(tweet.text, break_long_words=False)
            print(f"\tText: {text_lines[0] if text_lines else tweet.text}")
            for line in text_lines[1:]:
                print(f"\t{' ' * 5} {line}")

            # Print out the footer of the tweet
            print(f"\tReplies: {tweet.replies} | Retweets: {tweet.retweets} | Likes: {tweet.favorites}\n")

        total_time = time() - start_time
        print(f"\tStats\n\t{'=' * 5}")
        print(f"\tTotal tweets received: {total_tweets}")
        print(f"\tTotal time:            {total_time:4.2f} s")
        print(f"\tTweets per second:     {(total_tweets / total_time):4.2f} tps")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
    
```

**Run the example script**

```bash
python example.py
```

**Result**

## NOTE

Both the client library and the tweezer URL are solely for my use. **You may not use it**. This is just a personal project in my search for fast html parsing. All of this is run on a single thread with a max of 500MB RAM.
